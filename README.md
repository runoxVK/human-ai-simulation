# human-ai-simulation
This is a python simulation that simulates a digital environment where humans need to survive. They are given stats and must breed and remain healthy with water and food. Generations of humans can be observed and overall its a digital spectacle.

The number following the python file represents which version/iteration you are running. The highest number is the most recent iteration. Expect bugs in the older iterations.
